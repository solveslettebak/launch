# Launcher

## Description

Primarily a launcher for other applications, meant to be pinned on top. Has rapidly customizable menus that can be loaded on the fly depending on current task.

Idea is to include other small tools (PV monitor, reminders, etc) into it. 

Supports launching commandline tools with editable default arguments.

## Installation

Requires pyqt5. Otherwise all standard libraries. This may change.
