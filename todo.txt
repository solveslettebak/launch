This file is ignored by git, and is kept only in the MCR/launcher folder. Edit as you wish!

More important stuff:
- New menu format: human editable more easily, instead of json.
- Checkboxes in menu (for internal functions)
- Save settings on local computer, not shared (or some combination of local and shared settings)
- Implement "services" in menu file (or "startup" or something), for things that should run in background without user interaction
- Implement a "working directory" field for menu items, in case i need to change directory for the script or whatever to work (acronym.py for example..)
- Create a better PV-monitor/sniper detector
- Logbook-poll with popup (consider as stand-alone app), maybe with some integration with launcher.
	- Let launcher keep track of external applications launched from it?
- Service to keep phoebus layouts up to date between consoles where launcher is running (IF the current system for this isn't better.. don't know how that works)

Less important stuff:
- Make the pin/unpin thing work
- Make it movable
- Remember where on the screen it was previously, and save in settings.json - to re-start in the same place
- Make it resize nicely when reducing font size

DONE:- Change background color on hovered menu items
DONE:- Tooltips


Suggestions:
- More items about snipers
- <marquee> and <blink> tags
- ...
